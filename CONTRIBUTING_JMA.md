# Contributing to JMA Mineclone  
Thank you for contributing!  
We strive to create a fun server to play on, so we have some custom mods and modifications to VoxeLibre's code.  
Below we have listed our changes. Please take care to not overwrite these if you are updating to a newer version or such.
Also, if you make any changes to VoxeLibre's code, please do include those here for future reference.

## Changes from VoxeLibre

- **mods/other/** and **mods/extras/**
	This is where we keep our custom mods. These will not be documented here as they are not directly in VoxeLibre's code.

- **mods/ITEMS/mcl_enchanting/enchantments.lua**
	We have a custom enchantment, "Drill", which is registered in this file.

- **mods/ITEMS/mcl_mobitems/init.lua**
  	Dino Nuggets, a custom food craftable from Cooked Chicken, is registered here.
