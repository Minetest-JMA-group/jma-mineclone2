# VoxeLibre Get Comfortable

Adds commands to /lay or /sit to VoxeLibre (ex. MineClone2), as well as the
ability to sit on some blocks (stairs and slabs out-of-the-box) by
right-clicking them.

Port of the good old [cozy mod](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=14143)
(originally made for MTG by everamzah) to work with VL properly and even
provide some nice new features!
