Credits
========
* Inventory, GUI, and metadata code is from mcl_barrels.
* Fishing stuff is from mcl_fishing.
* Waterlogging code came from mcl_mangrove.
* Inventory drop upon digging code is from mcl_util.
* Textures are from MineClone 2, specifically water source texture and mob spawner texture. I will eventually get an official trap texture. See the MineClone 2 README and License files for the license on the textures.
* Finally, the minecraft fishing trap mods that I looked at for inspiration, and the YouTube video I once watched that included fishing traps. I will probably never find that video.
