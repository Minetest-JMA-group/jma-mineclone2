# Notes for Fishing Traps

Fishing traps are meant as an alternative way to obtain fish, instead of manually fishing for hours straight.

To keep fishing traps balanced, we aim to keep them

- Automatic (as it collects fish with no user interaction)
- Slower/worse than manually fishing (to encourage players to manually fish, and to prevent it from becoming OP)

To help achieve the above goals, we also aim to

- Make fishing trap loot tables worse than regular fishing
- Nerf loot tables if there are a low amount of water source blocks nearby (to encourage players to place it in a lake/sea, not a makeshift water hole (this also adds to realism that manual fishing lacks, thus encouraging manual fishing for better rates))
- Severely nerf loot tables to ~65% per fishing trap nearby (to make fishing trap farms less efficient and encouraging other food farms for late-game players)
