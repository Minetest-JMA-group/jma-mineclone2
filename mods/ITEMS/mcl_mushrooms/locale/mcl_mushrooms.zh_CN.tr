A single mushroom of this species will slowly spread over time towards a random solid opaque block with a light level of 12 or lower in a 3×3×3 cube around the mushroom. It stops spreading when there are 5 or more mushrooms of the same species within an area of 9×3×9 blocks around the mushroom.=这种品种的单个蘑菇会随着时间的推移，慢慢朝着蘑菇周围3×3×3立方体内光照等级为12或更低的随机固体不透明方块扩散，当蘑菇周围9×3×9方块区域内有5个或更多同种类蘑菇时，它就会停止扩散。
Mushrooms will eventually uproot at a light level of 12 or higher. On mycelium or podzol, they survive and spread at any light level.=蘑菇最终会在光照等级达到12或更高时连根拔起，在菌丝体或灰壤上，它们在任何光照等级下都能存活并扩散。
