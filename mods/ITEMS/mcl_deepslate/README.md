# VoxeLibre New Ores and Deepslate
by NO11

This mod adds Deepslate to the Luanti game VoxeLibre, which Minecraft adds in version 1.17.
Find new ores or build something from the 30 new blocks! Deepslate is generated directly above the lava layer in overworld.

All dependencies are automatically in the VoxeLibre game.
