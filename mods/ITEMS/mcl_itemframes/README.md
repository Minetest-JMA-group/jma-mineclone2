## `mcl_itemframes`

Adds regular and glowing item frames into VoxeLibre.

* Rewritten from scratch for Mineclonia by cora
* Ported to and adapted for VoxeLibre with changes by rudzik8

From original README.md:

> This mod has been rewritten from scratch for mineclonia. The old version was a
fork of the MTG itemframes mod heavily patched and added upon by mcl so that it
ultimately contained about 1000 lines of code.
>
> With the rewrite it was possible to reduce this to less than 300 and add the
possibility to place itemframes horizontally as well as a clean API to define
custom item holding nodes.
