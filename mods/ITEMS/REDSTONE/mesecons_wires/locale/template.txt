Transmits redstone power, powers mechanisms=
<<<<<<< HEAD
Redstone is a versatile conductive mineral which transmits redstone power. It can be placed on the ground as a trail.=
A redstone trail can be in two states: Powered or not powered. A powered redstone trail will power (and thus activate) adjacent redstone components.=
Redstone power can be received from various redstone components, such as a block of redstone or a button. Redstone power is used to activate numerous mechanisms, such as redstone lamps or pistons.=
Place redstone on the ground to build a redstone trail. The trails will connect to each other automatically and it can also go over hills.=
Read the help entries on the other redstone components to learn how redstone components interact.=
