### Mobs improvements
Creeper received some adjustments, should be smarter, but easier to avoid if you're quick. Axolotl on the other hand won't eat your sheep anymore.

Wither received a massive rework by Herowl, complete with custom attacks. Make sure to check him out, especially if you're up for a challenge.

Iron Golem received some AI changes by our new contributor, Codiac, which should prevent him getting lost so much.

Another rework done by Codiac was a change of how mob spawning takes light level into account. It should now be easier to prevent hostile spawns by lighting areas up, among other things.

### Stonecutter functionality
Stonecutter finally received its functionality! Thanks to the work done by ChrisPHP, Herowl and AFCMS you can now cut every kind of stone into slabs, stairs, and decorated variants with unprecedented ease.

### Campfire update
Another node that received a large update is the campfire, as well as the soul version. Thanks to the great work of PrairieWind, DinoNuggies4665, thunder1035, Wbjitscool, & AncientMariner, you can now cook items on them, and see it being done!

### Combat rebalancing
Combat should feel better than ever before with changes by Eliy21 and Herowl! Knockback is stronger and more visible, every hit causes a short window of damage resistance, critical hits are more stable, hunger-based health regeneration works slightly differently... check it out!

### Armor trims
You can now decorate your armor with colorful gems and metals on the smithing table thanks to the work of chmodsayshello.

### Path undoing
Welcome our very own feature, path undoing! Brought to you by SmokeyDope and Herowl, you can now convert paths back to dirt by shift+right-clicking them with a shovel.

### Formspec refactoring
Various GUI formspecs were updated in a massive rework by AFCMS to the newer version, as well as given new features. This includes survival and creative inventories (survival inventory got API allowing adding multiple tabs), as well as nodes like chests, furnaces, dispensers and hoppers.

### Hopper reimplementation
Speaking of hoppers, our new contributor, Morik666, did an amazing job implementing a new API for hoppers, allowing to add various ways for other nodes to interact with the hoppers, including the nodes added by mods.

### Pistons fixes
Pistons now work better thanks to seventeenthShulker, who fixed many bugs related to them. Sadly, even with these changes and the aforementioned hopper changes, not all mechanisms work as they should due to engine limitations that we are yet to make workarounds for.
